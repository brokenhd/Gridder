#Gridder

Here is the grid I came up with. I found this quite challenging, I haven't used compass on a project in production so I tried my best to brush up and do some cool things with it.

Even if this isn't quite up to your expectations, I learned a lot from the exercise.

**Notes:**
5/13/14 - Got started creating the grid, turns out it is a bit more complex than it looks at a glance. Set up images, git, compass, and my tools needed, and began to lay out the grid.

5/14/14 - Adjustments made on the pading of the columns.

5/15/14 - Columns not quite working with the ways I could think up, falling back to a simpler version, but still reuseable.

5/16/14 - Set up media queries and began laying out columns to fit each query, added some transition effects for a nicer time.

5/17/14 - Crazy day, worked on  final tweaks to get it working as well as I could get it.
